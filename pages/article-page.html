            <h2>Finding My Way in the Financial World: Why Can't I Do Everything?</h2>
            <article>
              
                <p>It is Monday morning and a new hire walks into the office, their steps hesitant but hopeful. The HR manager greets them warmly, hands over a welcome pack and begins explaining their role. “Focus is key,” they say. “Start small, master this area, and then grow.” It is sound advice and yet, it makes me wonder: why must growth only happen in one direction?</p>
              
                <p>The idea of limiting oneself to a single focus feels almost counterintuitive to me. Take chartered accountancy, for instance. From the moment I started studying, I knew this was the foundation I wanted to build my career on. It is a discipline that shines on precision, analysis and decision-making. The ability to transform raw numbers into actionable insights is what drew me to it. But as much as I value the structure of accounting, I have always believed that a foundation is just that. A starting point. Not the final destination.</p>
              
                <p>Fast forward a few months and our new hire has settled into their role. They are excelling at their tasks, but they begin to notice the bigger picture: budgets, forecasts and performance metrics shaping the organisation’s future. This is where managerial finance comes into play. In my own journey during my first postgraduate year (just last year) I stumbled upon a new fascination: managerial finance. The way it ties together performance evaluations, business valuations and equity analyses opened a whole new world of possibilities for me. It was no longer just about accounting; I found myself deeply intrigued by the art and science of financial decision-making. I began to picture myself as not only a chartered accountant but also a chartered financial analyst. The challenge and precision of valuations captured my imagination and I knew I wanted to dive deeper into that space.</p>
              
                <p>But growth is not always linear. One day, our hypothetical hire notices inefficiencies in the workflow. They propose a solution, only to hear, “That is not your responsibility; let internal audit handle it.” Internal audit? Now that is a field I have recently discovered and grown to admire. About a month ago, the new interest caught my attention. It is the kind of field that requires a rigorous attention to detail, a deep understanding of organisational processes and a commitment to ensuring compliance and efficiency. The idea of being a certified internal auditor began to excite me as much as my earlier ambitions. It was not that I was changing my mind; it felt more like I was expanding my horizons. I am confident that internal auditing is something I can excel at. There is a certain satisfaction in being the person who ensures an organisation is running smoothly, with systems in place to mitigate risks and ensure everything is compliant. This ability to make organisations better, one system at a time, struck a chord with me. Maybe it is my love for solving puzzles or my tendency to ask “why” a thousand times, but this field feels like it was made for someone like me. My favourite hobbies are both playing Soduku and debating. (Oh boy, I am a nerd)</p>
              
                <p>And then there is technology, the constant companion of modern professionals. Picture our new hire staring at a spreadsheet, struggling to make sense of it, until someone whispers, “You could automate that, you know.” For me, technology is an enabler. I have taught myself coding, designed my own website and mastered advanced Excel features, all because I wanted to understand how technology could transform the way we work. This whirlwind of interests has made me realise something about myself: I genuinely enjoy learning. I find immense satisfaction in challenging myself with new knowledge. In fact, the very website you are reading right now is something I built myself which is a small testament to my curiosity and willingness to figure things out.</p>
              
                <p>So here is the question: should that new hire stay in their lane or should they let their curiosity lead them to bigger things? In South Africa, where industries like mining, manufacturing, and agriculture constantly evolve, professionals cannot afford to think in silos. From managing volatile markets to navigating stringent regulations, versatility is not just an asset, it is a requirement. Across Africa, this adaptability becomes even more crucial as businesses tackle sustainability, innovation, and economic growth on a continental scale.</p>
              
                <p>But back to our story. Five years in, our new hire has climbed the ladder. They have specialised, yes, but they have also diversified their skills, proving that growth does not have to mean choosing one path. That is the kind of career I envision for myself. I do not see my varied interests as distractions; I see them as complementary tools in my professional toolkit.</p>
              
                <p>Am I stretching myself too thin? Maybe. Or maybe I am building a career that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the world we live in. Why settle for one label when I can redefine what it means to succeed in finance?</p>
              
                <p>Sometimes, I wonder if it would be simpler if I could just pick one thing, like someone deciding to be a chef and committing to it for life. They get to focus, get to specialise and over time, their expertise speaks for itself. But then again, can I really be content limiting myself to just one flavour? Why can I not be the chef who masters every single dish, every single aspect of the kitchen? Why can I not have the best of every world? I am not just content with doing things halfway; I want to be exceptional at everything I set my mind to. Sure, it might be a lot, but is not that what makes it exciting?</p>
              
                <p>In twenty years, will I be able to trace the value I have created across disciplines, industries, and organisations? I believe so. So, here I am, contemplating whether I am trying to do too much with my career, or whether this drive to master everything is what will set me apart in the long run. Maybe I am not just hungry for success; maybe I am hungry for the challenge itself.</p>
              
                <p>So do I want CA, CFA or CIA? The answer is yes.</p>
              
                <p>It is no wonder why my favourite movie of all time is the dystopian, <em>Divergent</em>.</p>
