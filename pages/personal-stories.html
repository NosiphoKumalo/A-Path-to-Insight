        <h1>Personal Stories</h1>
        <p>I am great with numbers, though I acknowledge that I am still finding the ideal balance in optimising the balance in my personal life. I can handle complex financial statements without breaking a sweat, but managing personal responsibilities brings a different set of priorities into play.</p>
        <p>In my final undergraduate year, I found myself studying for an auditing exam while going through a time of adversity (I was not in the right emotional frame of mind during that time). I spent hours trying to understand auditor responsibilities for reportable irregularities all while contending a personal uncertainty. Despite the tears, the distractions, and the emotional rollercoaster, I ended up with a 76% distinction. So yeah, when life throws curveballs, I may cry a little—but I still get the job done.</p>
        <p>In my Honours year, 2024, the challenges did not stop there. Between encountering obstacles with tuition funding, accommodation drama and costly textbooks, I was really starting to question my career path. But then, just when I was about to throw in the towel by July, a surprising breakthrough happened: a bursary appeared. Six months of stress, late-night breakdowns, and wondering if my future was a financial risk all led to that moment. And even though I only "missed the mark" on two out of five modules, I learned way more from that experience than I could ever have from just acing everything. Sometimes, it’s the messy moments that teach you the most.</p>
        <p>While my personal life may still need some spreadsheet-like organising, when it comes to work, I’m all about results. I know how to navigate through chaos and pressure, and if I can survive emotional curveballs and financial stress while still delivering, then I am pretty confident I can handle any challenge that comes my way at work.</p>
