            <h2>Learning to Love Precision, One Working Paper at a Time</h2>
            <p class="article-date">9 November 2025</p>

            <p>It still feels surreal to say this out loud, but I have my first real job. Nine months in, I am still pinching myself sometimes. A desk. A laptop. Deadlines. Meetings that could have been emails. Colleagues who make the chaos feel like an adventure. And me, pretending I know what I am doing while secretly hoping nobody notices the first job sign flashing above my head. Honestly, I could not have asked for a better start.</p>

            <p>My colleagues are the kind of people HR dreams about. Seniors willing to teach, guide, and believe in potential that is sometimes buried under my very obvious fresh graduate enthusiasm. I am endlessly grateful for their patience, for the opportunities to learn, and for showing me that professional growth is as much about discovering your strengths as it is about learning the craft.</p>

            <p>And what have I learned? To actually audit. Not the textbooks, not the exam simulations. Real internal audit. Working papers. Risk assessments. Sampling. Asking why eleven times until the answer finally sticks. My BCom Accounting background prepared me well. It taught me structure, analysis, and precision. Those skills I developed from an external audit perspective are now being applied in a new way. External audit gave me the foundation. Internal audit allows me to test assertions in a way that goes beyond identifying issues. It is about understanding risks, designing solutions, and making processes better. Both disciplines are rigorous, both are essential, and both demand excellence. The difference is in perspective.</p>

            <p>One of the moments that challenged me deeply was auditing the tools used in production. Counting, verifying, checking Capexs. I still do not know exactly what I missed, but my work was questioned. Cue dramatic internal monologue: Nosipho, you cannot miss this. Not today. Not ever again. Since then, I have approached every working paper with extreme precision, treating every section with equal importance, thinking carefully about the risks in testing each area, and ensuring due diligence is thorough. Every fault must be found, every risk raised, every concern questioned. And truthfully, does that not sound thrilling?</p>

            <p>Challenges are not new to me. They have been part of who I am for as long as I can remember. I love diving into problems, tackling them independently, and seeing every angle before collaborating with others. It is only when I step back and appreciate the bigger picture that collaboration becomes meaningful. In nine months, I have drafted five policies. Two of them were for some of our most complicated divisions, with full responsibility and guidance from seniors. They approved my suggestions, and the sense of creating something that actually works, that drives real change, is immensely satisfying.</p>

            <p>Nine months in, I have had incredible highs and moments that humbled me. Mistakes reminded me that diligence is everything. Opportunities showed me that real impact comes from blending knowledge, analysis, and confidence. And through it all, my passions from my first article remain intact. I still crave challenges that stretch my abilities. I still want to grow, to push boundaries, and to do everything I start with excellence. It is not a matter of curiosity alone, it is a part of who I am.</p>

            <p>I am learning about myself every day. About what excites me, what frustrates me, what drives me, and what I will not compromise on. Nine months in, I know that a career that excites me will always demand more, will always test me, and will always require that I think deeply, act boldly, and question relentlessly.</p>

            <p>So yes, I am still hungry. Hungry to learn, hungry to solve problems, hungry to do everything I set my mind to exceptionally well. And perhaps that hunger, that insistence on excellence in every step, is the thing that will shape a career that is unapologetically mine, in every sense.</p>
